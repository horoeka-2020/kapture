Openly and honestly
Via Slack Channel if not in person

### Branch vs Main
Task branching agreed that undergo peer review before merge

## How will we work:
### Which agile roles will be adopted
Would like to try to self manage instead of allocating roles.  No-one had a desire to get experience in a specific role

### What Aile Rituals will be used:
1. Stand-ups
2. Retrospectives
3. Ellaborations?

### How will we survive?
By being kind to ourselves and each other
Try to eat lunch together
Focus on having fun as well as learning
If tension arises try to address it early rather than bottling it up
Fun times?  Stand-ups

### How will we individually and as a team get the help we need for both:
#### Technically 
TO BE COMPLETED

#### Non-technically
TO BE COMPLETED
